# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
<!-- Models are use to outline the logic of the app develop, in this outline validations of data are included as well as relationships between databases. -->
```

## Define Controller Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
<!-- Responsible to handle CRUD  -->
```

## Define Router Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
<!-- The router recognizes action methods and sends them to controllers. -->
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
<!-- The request is sent to the router, the router sends the request to the controller, the controller to the model, and the model to the database; then the database sends data to the model, the model sends the data in form of an object to the controller and the controller sends a response. -->
```
